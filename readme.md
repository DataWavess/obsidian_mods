plugins used to have file reveal in explorer:

I use the first plugin to have the folders close all non active folders and open only the active folder path for the current note. And I needed the second plugin to keep the context of the current note under my cursor. As the first plugin (if I remember right) would move your cursor/mouse context to the folder explorer and not keep it in the note.

Since the first plugin is removed from github. You might not want to use it... But I included its folder in this repo.
